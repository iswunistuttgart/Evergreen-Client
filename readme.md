# Evergreen-Client
The Evergreen-Client is a web-application, where users can remote control machine tools. Dependent on the current situation, the users can customize their own user-interfaces with widgets like buttons, graphs, inpufields, outputfields, switch-buttons, LED-lamps.
The Evergreen-Client will only work if the the evergreen-soap-server(soap-webservice) and the machine-server(OPC-UA server) is running.

## Getting Started:

First you have to install node.js and npm to run the Node-App, which represents a middleware-software, handling the soap messages. Then you have to install webpack to build the Evergreen-Client. After that you can access the Evergreen-Client via browser.


## 1. What is NPM and how to install ?

NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules. 
A package in Node.js contains all the files you need for a module.
Modules are JavaScript libraries you can include in your project.

The best way to install npm is to install node using the node.js installer. npm is installed as part of node.

It’s over at <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Nodejs.org</a>. It will give you a recent, working version of npm with all the paths in the expected places. 
Once you’ve installed Node.js, you can make sure you’ve got the very most recent version of npm using npm itself:

 ```
 > sudo npm install npm -g
 ```


(on Windows, you can drop the “sudo” but you should run it as administrator). Running this update will give you the most recent stable version of npm, also supported by npm Inc.

## 2. What is Webpack and how to install?

webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

The best way to install webpack is to install webpack with npm

 ```
 > npm install --save-dev webpack
 ```


## 3. Ceckout repo and run Node-App

Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/iswunistuttgart/Evergreen-Client.git
> cd Evergreen-Client
> npm install
> npm start (starting without webservice "node server.js --webservice")

```

## 3. Download repo and run Node-App
 Download the .zip file.  Extract the contents of the zip file, then open your terminal, change to the project directory, and:

 ```
 > npm install
 > npm start
 ```
 
 ## 4. Build Evergreen-Client
Open a new tab on your terminal and:
 ```
 > webpack -w
 ```
Wait till Evergreen-Client is build

## 5. Access Evergreen-Client:
Type in localhost:3000 in browser
